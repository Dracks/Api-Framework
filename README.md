Api-Framework
=============

API's framework in nodejs and mongo db


## Main idea
The main idea it's create an easy api framework, that includes user administration and module administration as basic tools in nodejs and mongodb, and also have three points of input-output information that will be the following:

* /api/version/module: The api response of every module/plugin installed on the framework
* /admin/module: The administration panel of this module. 
* / : The web vision of the contents of plugins. 
 
Actually it's only implemented the API for User, it accepts create, and login using a token based on oaut. All help was welcome. I design this architecure based on a prototype of APIs I've been made before for a prototype of a game. 

(All the commits before publish the sourcode are in catalan, sorry, I don't think to publish, but when my time goes out because I started a new job, and after see the implementation of APIs in my new job, I think this framework/tools should be a god base to work for a lot of people if it was finished)

Thanks.
